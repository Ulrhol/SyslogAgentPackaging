# SyslogAgentPackaging

This is a meta project to package the eminent SyslogAgent software from Datagram. 

It requires the nsis package and a working environment to build the packages from the script.  

It does not contain any binaries or intellectual property from Datagram, only the nsis files required to package it up and a list of receivers to ease the configuration and setup.

The list of receivers will take one item per line and split on " ", so always put the IP first and the description or whatever you like afterwards.
